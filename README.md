### Team ID : C242-PS232		
Illusion is a mobile app that leverages machine learning to distinguish between real and AI-generated faces, offering a reliable tool to combat misinformation and ensure trust in digital content.

## 🚀Mission
The mission of our app is to empower individuals and businesses to navigate the digital landscape with confidence by providing an effective tool to identify and mitigate the risks posed by deepfake technology. We aim to foster trust and transparency in digital content, reduce the spread of misinformation, and protect against AI-generated fraud.

## 💡Solution
Our app leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and identify the subtle differences between real human faces and AI-generated images. By focusing on detecting distinctive patterns and artifacts unique to deepfake content, the app provides users with:
1. Image Detection: A robust detection system that evaluates whether a face is real or AI-generated, ensuring good accuracy and dependability.
2. User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive design that allows users of all technical backgrounds to access and understand the results effectively.
3. Confidence Scoring: A feature that provides a percentage-based confidence score, giving users insight into the likelihood of an image being AI-generated.
